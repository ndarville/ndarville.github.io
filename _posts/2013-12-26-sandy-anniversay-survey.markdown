    This blog post is an attempt to summarize as accessibly as possible Monmouth University Polling Institute's poll report, <i><a href="http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/e3a9c1b9-dd05-430b-adab-5dfd4b7afede.pdf">Displaced New Jerseyans Negative on Sandy Recovery Efforts&mdash;Many still need help making ends meet</a></i> (.pdf).

    "The Monmouth University Polling Institute released the first wave of results from a tracking panel of New Jersey residents who were displaced by Superstorm Sandy for at least one month. Few of these families feel like they are close to full recovery and most feel that the state's rebuilding efforts have overlooked them."
</div>

The sample size was `683` displaced "New Jersey residents who were displaced by Superstorm Sandy for at least one month"; 90% of respondents' counties were Monmouth (51%) and Ocean (39%). More information on methodology and panel demographics is available in the [original report][report].

If you want to calculate the confidence interval for the percentages, you can do so [here][calculate].

    <p>&lsquo;The Sandy recovery effort is certainly a tale of two states. New Jerseyans who were displaced by the storm, even if they are now back in their homes, are significantly more negative than other Garden State residents about the pace and focus of recovery,&rsquo; said Patrick Murray, director for the Monmouth University Polling Institute, which is conducting the ongoing study under a grant from the New Jersey Recovery Fund.&rdquo;</p>

Read [the full report][report], which contains even more information and findings.

I have made more readabale---but more important *exportable*---version of some of the tables in the survey are available [here][docs]. I haven't double-checked the values, so make sure to do so before using the tables yourself. You are free to use my redesign of the spreadsheets from Google Docs as you see fit; you'll have to ask the Monmouth University Polling Institute about what you can do with their data, though.
