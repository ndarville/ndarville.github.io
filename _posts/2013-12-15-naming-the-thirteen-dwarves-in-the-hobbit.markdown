There are two great tools for remembering a long list:

* Association
* Categorization

If you have to remember the number `4586486448464`, you'll want to break it down into somehow else than a sequence of thirteen arbitrary digits. The same goes for the **thirteen** dwarves (dwarrows) in Tolkien's <i>The Hobbit</i>.

I recently saw [this][armitage] clip of Richard Armitage, who plays Thorin, naming all the dwarves in <i>The Hobbit</i>. As someone with a dreadful memory, I was very impressed---and then I noticed a pattern.

This is the order in which Armitage named the dwarves; see if you notice the pattern:

1. Dori
2. Nori
3. Ori
4. Bifur
5. Bofur
6. Bombur
7. Dwalin
8. Balin
9. Oin
10. Gloin
11. Fili
12. Kili
13. Thorin

Let's divide these names into **families**:

1. Dori, Nori, Ori
2. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur
3. Dwalin, Balin
4. Oin, Gloin
5. Fili, Kili

... and Thorin

Now we have reduced the burden of memorization to **five** families ... plus one.

<div class="box info">
    Remembering thirteen names is hard. Remembering five families plus one is much easier.
</div>

But there is another pattern to Armitage's memorization. Can you see it? (It's just like Sesame Street.)

* **3** members
    - Dori, Nori, Ori
    - Bifur, Bofur, Bombur
* **2** members
    - Dwalin, Balin
    - Oin, Gloin
    - Fili, Kili

... and Thorin.

In case you don't see the pattern, we group families into threes and twos---plus one---based on the amount of members.

<div class="box info">
    Now you only have to remember a group of threes and twos ... plus one.
</div>

You might still get tripped up trying to recall how many families go in each group of threes and twos.

As long as you remember the number **6**, this will never happen. You can see why, if you rewrite the list above:

* `3x2` `(=6)`
* `2x3` `(=6)`
* `+1`

<div class="box info">
    The group of threes has two families; the group of twos have three.

    <p>Each multiply to our magic number, <strong>6</strong>. And then there's Thorin, of course.</p>
</div>

You should be able to name all thirteen dwarves (dwarrows) now. I'm not kidding. Try it.
