title:  "The Rape Culture in the U.S. Military in Five Charts"
categories: blog
---
The United States military has a toxic culture; it enables the people who commit sexual assault, and it punishes the survivors.

A [report][report] published earlier this year proves it.

The report was published by the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO). The finding that received the most coverage was this figure for the period of fiscal-year 2012 (Oct 1 to Sep 30):

<div class="box emphasis">
    <ul>
        <li>Reported sexual assaults: <strong>2,959</strong></li>
        <li>Estimated sexual assaults: <strong>26,000</strong></li>
    </ul>
</div>

And this is just one of many harrowing findings.

Reading the report is not easy and takes a long time, not to mention an emotional toll, but it's comprehensive and chock-full of information; it's a great work. You shouldn't be expected to read the report, so I have created an executive summary in **five charts**.

### Do Something, Take Action

Senator [Kirsten Gillibrand][profile] is currently fighting to pass a Senate bill entitled [Military Justice Improvement Act][homepage] (MJIA)[^1], which is currently being denied the opportunity of a Senate vote. After that, the House will need to pass their version of the bill. [This][govtrack] is what the legislative roadmap ahead looks like.

Hopefully, you'll realize the urgency of taking action and urging your legislators to pass Sen. Gillibrand's bill---even though it's just the first step.

Find your representatives now---not tomorrow, not in a week---and tell them it matters; here are two ways of finding your their name and office contact information:

1. By using [this][reps] website.
2. By getting the [Sunlight Foundation's app][sunlight].
     * On your iPhone, visit [this][locator] link to go straight to the locator.

Please read [Congress Merge's guide][rep-guide] to ensure you contact and communicate with your representatives in the most effective manner.
