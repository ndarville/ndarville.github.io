title:  "The Rape Culture in the U.S. Military in Five Charts"
categories: blog
---
The United States military has a toxic culture; it enables the people who commit sexual assault, and it punishes the survivors.

A [report][report] published earlier this year proves it.

The report was published by the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office **(SAPRO)**. The finding that received the most coverage was this figure for the period of fiscal-year 2012 (Oct 1 to Sep 30):

<div class="box emphasis">
    <ul>
        <li>Reported sexual assaults: <strong>2,959</strong></li>
        <li>Estimated sexual assaults: <strong>26,000</strong></li>
    </ul>
</div>

And this is just one of many harrowing findings.

Reading the report is not easy and takes a long time, not to mention an emotional toll, but it's comprehensive and chock-full of information; it's a great work. You shouldn't be expected to read the report, so I have created an executive summary in **five charts**.

### Do Something, Take Action

Senator [Kirsten Gillibrand][profile] (D-NY) is currently fighting to pass a Senate bill entitled the [Military Justice Improvement Act][homepage] **(MJIA)**[^mjia]. It's currently being denied a vote. Should the bill go forward, which is far from guaranteed, its roadmap would look like [this][govtrack].

Hopefully, you see the urgency of taking action and moving your friends and legislators to support Sen. Gillibrand's bill as-is---even though it's just the first step.

**Find your representatives now**---not tomorrow, not in a week---and make them understand that this is something their constitutents want, and that failing to support the bill is not going to go over well with them.

Here are two ways of finding your their name and office contact information:

1. With [this website][reps].
2. With [this app][sunlight].
     * On your iPhone, you can visit [this][locator] link to go straight to the app's locator.
